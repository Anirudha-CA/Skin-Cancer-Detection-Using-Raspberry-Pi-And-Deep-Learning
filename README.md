## Introduction

Skin cancer is a common and potentially life-threatening disease that can benefit from early detection. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to create a model capable of accurately classifying skin lesions as benign or malignant. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification, and it is implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset of skin lesion images labeled by dermatologists.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of skin lesion images, labeled as either benign or malignant. The images are obtained from various reliable sources and have been carefully reviewed and annotated by dermatologists. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model architecture used for this project is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by Max Pooling 2D for downsampling, a Flatten layer to convert the data into a 1D vector, and fully connected Dense layers for classification. The model architecture is designed to capture relevant features from the skin lesion images and make accurate predictions.

## Training

The model is trained using the training dataset. During training, the model learns to optimize its weights and biases to minimize the loss function using the Adam optimizer. The training process involves feeding batches of images through the network, computing the loss, and updating the model parameters through backpropagation. The model's performance is monitored using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on the testing dataset to assess its performance and generalization ability. The evaluation metrics are calculated based on the predicted labels and ground truth labels. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and overall performance in classifying skin lesions.
